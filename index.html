    <h2><strong>History Of ST Placids School And Collage.</strong></h2>
    <p>
      The school was founded in 1853 as Bandel Catholic Free School by the Anglo
      Belgian Benedictines. Two years later it was transferred to the
      Congregation of Holy Cross. It was renamed St. Placid's School in 1883,[1]
      after a Benedictine Saint of the 6th century. View of SPHSC Saint Placid's
      is one of many English medium schools that were started by Christian
      missionaries during the time of the British rule. The schools were used to
      educate the Christian community of the regions they served to give them
      the advantages of education in the British ruled Indian subcontinent. They
      were also used to promote the conversion of people to Christianity
      especially from the poor who saw the schools as an added benefit for their
      children. Throughout their history though, these schools also took in
      students who were the children of the wealthy who could afford the fees
      that were charged to non-Christians. These students may have formed the
      majority and also provided income to the schools. After independence, the
      schools remained and adapted to the new countries they served (India,
      Pakistan and later Bangladesh as it became independent of Pakistan). They
      catered more and more to the children of the emerging middle class and
      also had a secular public front that was aligned with the religious
      sensitivities of the local people. At St. Placid's in the 1960s for
      example, the day started with the national anthem at assembly and when the
      students reached their "home room" they recited he Lord's Prayer, which
      was deemed consistent with both Muslim and Christian beliefs. Throughout
      recent history, the success of such schools was due in part to what the
      educated classes saw as the failure of the public education system. St.
      Placid's as well as similar schools filled the gap between what was seen
      by the educated and affluent members of society as the best education for
      obtaining the most desirable jobs in the government and business, and what
      the public education offered. As of 2015, Principal Prodip Louis Rozario
      heads 68 teachers instructing 2,505 pupils.[1]
